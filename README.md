- Developed an AI voice assistant using OpenAI's Whisper API for speech recognition and GPT-3.5-Turbo API for response generation, integrated with Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API for response delivery.
- Integrated an Artificial Neural Network (Tensorflow) model, with an impressive accuracy of 99.98%, to identify users' accents and respond in similar accents, enhancing the user experience for English speakers interacting with the Generative Pre-trained Transformer model.
- Technologies Used: Whisper API, GPT-3.5-Turbo API, Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API, Gradio by Hugging face, Jupyter, Tensorflow.
- Contributions: Led the end-to-end research and development, including API integration, accent recognition model implementation, and user experience enhancement.
- Outcomes: Improved accessibility of advanced language models like the GPT for English speakers across the world.
